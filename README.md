fcw2svg
=======

A utility to convert CC3's FCW files to SVG.

Much of this code is a port of some Java code that does much the same thing. It's also
inspired from some code written by Ross Alexander, but it's been pretty significantly
re-written.

In order to compile this code, one needs access to the FastCAD XP toolkit, which one
can download over here:
